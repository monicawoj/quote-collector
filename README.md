# README

This is a Ruby on Rails web app that can be used to add and view your favorite quotes. Quotes exist across four categories.

The app is controlled by a Quotes controller, and different views exists to view, edit, update, and delete quotes.

The "Quote of the Day" welcome page can be used as a Desktop screensaver for a little uplifting during the day!
